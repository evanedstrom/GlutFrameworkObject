{"name":"Simple GL Framework","tagline":"A GLUT framework wrapper designed to make getting a simple graphical application going quickly.","body":"## Overview\r\nGL Framework provides a bare-bones intro to graphics programming with OpenGL and GLUT.\r\nDetailed documentation available at: http://doxy.glutfmk.evanedstrom.com\r\n\r\nThe framework is comprised of two main components, Engine and Element.\r\n\r\n## Engine\r\n* Initializes GLUT and handles key events, window resizing, projection matrix setup / scaling, and a basic frame timer.\r\n* Contains a list of Elements that are drawn on each frame.\r\n* Provides before draw loop and after draw loop virtual functions for things like scorekeeping or collision detection.\r\n* Subscribes to events for key and mouse handling.\r\n\r\n## Element\r\n* Contains a coordinate system for positioning objects in 3D space.\r\n* Contains velocity, scale and rotation variables.\r\n* Draw() and Move() functions called in engine display loop using polymorphism.\r\n* Overwrite Draw() in a subclass to get specific drawing behavior.\r\n* Overwrite Move() in a subclass to get specific movement behavior.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n* The master branch contains solution for Visual Studio 2013.\r\n* There is a branch that contains a Visual Studio 2012 solution if needed.\r\n\r\n## More Info\r\nWritten for Whitworth University for use in introductory programming courses.\r\n> Author: [Evan Edstrom](http://evanedstrom.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
